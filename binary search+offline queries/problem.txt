There is a hotel with n rooms. The rooms are represented by a 2D integer array rooms where rooms[i] = [roomIdi, sizei] denotes that there is a room with room number roomIdi and size equal to sizei. Each roomIdi is guaranteed to be unique.

You are also given k queries in a 2D array queries where queries[j] = [preferredj, minSizej]. The answer to the jth query is the room number id of a room such that:

The room has a size of at least minSizej, and
abs(id - preferredj) is minimized, where abs(x) is the absolute value of x.
If there is a tie in the absolute difference, then use the room with the smallest such id. If there is no such room, the answer is -1.

Return an array answer of length k where answer[j] contains the answer to the jth query.

 

Example 1:

Input: rooms = [[2,2],[1,2],[3,2]], queries = [[3,1],[3,3],[5,2]]
Output: [3,-1,3]
Explanation: The answers to the queries are as follows:
Query = [3,1]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 3) = 0, and its size of 2 is at least 1. The answer is 3.
Query = [3,3]: There are no rooms with a size of at least 3, so the answer is -1.
Query = [5,2]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 5) = 2, and its size of 2 is at least 2. The answer is 3.
