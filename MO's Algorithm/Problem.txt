 in this problem using brute force will give a time complexity of O(n*q)

 so we need a better approach

 The main trick behind the MO's algorithm is sorting the queries in chunks of sqrt(N) parts in increasing with respect to left bounds (ascending in right in case of ties)
 
 Then the time complexity reduces to O( Q*sqrt(N) + N*sqrt(N) == O( (N+Q)*sqrt(N))  =O(1+2)
 
 where first term refers to the total number of shifting of left pointer and second(2) term for right pointer
