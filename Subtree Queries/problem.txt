You are given a rooted tree consisting of n nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n, and node 1 is the root. Each node has a value.

Your task is to process following types of queries:
change the value of node s to x
calculate the sum of values in the subtree of node s
Input

The first input line contains two integers n and q: the number of nodes and queries. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n.

The next line has n integers v1,v2,…,vn: the value of each node.

Then there are n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contans two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each query is either of the form "1 s x" or "2 s".

Output

Print the answer to each query of type 2.
